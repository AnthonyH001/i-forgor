In 10.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all people who have directed a movie that received a rating of at least 9.0.
Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.


get name from people
                |
                where their id matches being a director
                        |
                        directed a movie where rating >= 9.0
                            in (select id from movies where id in (select movie_id from ratings where rating >= 9.0 ))
